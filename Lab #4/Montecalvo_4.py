Program Prompt: Write a program that will determine the change a user will receive based on the total cost of all
items they want to purchase. The user should be able to enter as many items as they want. After a user enters
an itemâ€™s cost, also ask them if this item will be taxed. If the item will be taxed, calculate the taxable amount.
The user should be able to use either a y or a Y to re-enter the loop and add another item cost as well as to
signal that the current item they have entered is taxable. When the user has finished entering all of their items
the program should display: the total number of items purchased, the total cost of all items, the total taxable
amount of taxed items, and the final total due (cost + tax). Once all of the values are printed, prompt the user
for the amount tendered (money they are paying with). Then, redisplay the final total cost of all items, the
amount tendered, and the change the user will receive. All monetary values must be formatted to display to
the 2nd decimal place and all decimals should align on top of one another when displayed (following the
format of a physical receipt).

Variable Dictionary:

items: list that holds the price of all the items.
tax: total tax for purchases.
taxRate: rate of tax.
priceResponse: price for current item.
taxResponse: yes or no if tax applies to item
repeatResponse: yes or no if user wants to add more items.
subtotal: subtotal.
finalCost: total cost after tax.
money: how much money the user is paying with.
change: the change that the program returns.
